Features
========

The IntLevy-Processes package offers a variety of features for simulating, analyzing, and classifying complex stochastic processes. Key features include:

1. **Process Simulation**
   - Generate synthetic intermittent and Lévy trajectories.
   - Simulate realistic intermittent processes using various statistical distributions.

2. **Statistical Moments Calculation**
   - Calculate theoretical and empirical second and fourth moments.
   - Allows for detailed statistical analysis of trajectories.

3. **Optimization for Model Fitting**
   - Provides optimization routines to fit model parameters to empirical data.
   - Enables accurate parameter estimation for intermittent and Lévy models.

4. **Classification**
   - Classify processes as intermittent or Lévy based on statistical properties.
   - Uses threshold-based and Fisher’s exact test-based classifications.

5. **Utilities for Data Processing**
   - Common functions for handling and processing data.
   - Includes utilities for data transformation, statistical calculations, and moment calculations.
