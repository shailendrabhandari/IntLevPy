- **Process Simulation:** Generate synthetic intermittent and Lévy flight trajectories.
- **Moments Calculation:** Compute theoretical and empirical moments of trajectories.
- **Optimization:** Fit model parameters to empirical data using optimization techniques.
- **Classification:** Differentiate between intermittent and Lévy processes using statistical methods.

For detailed documentation and examples, visit the [IntLevPy Documentation](https://intlevpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

Install **IntLevPy** directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install IntLevPy
```

## Usage

To use **IntLevPy**, import the relevant modules and functions in your Python script or notebook. The package provides functions for simulating processes, computing moments, performing optimizations, and classifying trajectories.


### Applying to Real-Life Data

**IntLevPy** can be applied to real-life datasets, such as eye-tracking data or financial time series, for classification and analysis using the provided statistical methods.

An example notebook demonstrating the usage of an eye-tracking dataset can be found in the [Example Notebook](https://github.com/shailendrabhandari/IntLevPy/blob/main/intermittent_levy/examples/example.ipynb).
